# 🚀 Camouflaged Mobile Air Defense System (C-MADS)

### 📖 Project Description
C-MADS is an autonomous mobile air defense platform capable of detecting and tracking moving objects. 
The project will develop embedded system software, sensor fusion, and image processing algorithms.

### 👥 Team Members
- Begüm Ercihan 
- Ecesu Nasuhoğlu 
- İlknur Göçkon
- Oğuzhan Şahin

### 🧠 Project Objectives
- Real-time sensor data collection and processing
- Implementation of object detection and tracking algorithms (e.g., YOLO)
- Ensuring stable motion and control of the mobile platform
- Sensor fusion of multiple modalities (camera, LiDAR) to improve target detection accuracy
- Autonomous and manual operation modes with operator override capability
- Emergency Stop (E-Stop) and optional autonomous withdrawal/escape behavior
- Validation of system performance in controlled test scenarios using non-harmful symbolic targets (LED markers, balloons, or simulation)
- Development of a ROS-based modular software architecture for easy expansion

### 🛠️ Technologies to be Used
- Python 
- Jetson Orin Nano
- ROS2
- YOLO for object detection
